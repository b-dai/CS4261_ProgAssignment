## How to Run
Follow the instructions at https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup to install React Native and Expo Go.
Clone this repo into an expo project and cd into it.
Make sure dependencies are installed with 'npm install' or 'yarn'.
Run 'npx expo start' or 'npx expo start --tunnel' (if the first one doesn't work) while connected to Expo Go on phone.
