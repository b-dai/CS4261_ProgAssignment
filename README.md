## How to Run
Follow the instructions at https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup to install React Native and necessary environments, and install Expo Go on your phone app store.<br/>
Clone this repo into an expo project (after following the previous link to setup an expo project) and cd into it.<br/>
Make sure dependencies are installed with 'npm install' or 'yarn'.<br/>
Run 'npx expo start' or 'npx expo start --tunnel' (if the first one doesn't work).<br/>
It will ask you to scan a QR code in terminal to open Expo Go on phone, then you can freely use the app.
